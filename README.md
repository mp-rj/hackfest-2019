# HACKFEST 2019: "A Rio of Data"
Para Português, veja o [LEIAME].

## What is it?

The idea behind the Hackfest movement is to bring together professionals,
students, people in the civil society and from governments who are interested
in developing digital solutions as tools for exercising citizenship and
creating better public policies.

At the end of the event, all applications developed will be available under
open source licenses for the use and improvement by the public, by governments
and by control agencies.


## Getting started

The Hackfest 2019: "A Rio of Data" will take place from October 10th to 13th,
in the headquarters of the Ministério Público do Rio de Janeiro ([directions]).
The event will feature lectures, workshops and a hackathon in which teams will
develop solutions with the help of experts in technology and in public
policies. To register, access the [event website].

On the first day, participants will team up and select a set of socially
relevant problems that they will try to solve during the hackathon. In
the following days, the teams will develop a prototype solution with the
assistance of expert tutors, and will present it at the end of the event.

The best solutions will be selected to a second stage of the competition and may receive a prize of up to BRL$9.000,00.
